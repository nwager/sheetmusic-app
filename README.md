# Sheet Music App

As a musically-illiterate electric bass player, I was disappointed in the quality of tab-writing software. This project is meant to provide a simple app for writing both tabs and sheet music with persistent data storage using a Firebase Realtime Database. This also demonstrates full-stack development by including database interaction and structuring as well as UX/UI design.
